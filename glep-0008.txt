Another idea stolen from somebody else :) This time I stole the idea from 
a KDE developer name Scott Wheeler who runs a program called 
adopt-a-geek [1]_.

Abstract
========

I would like to start a program to bring together Gentoo'ers who need 
hardware, and those that have hardware to donate. This project will 
hopefully get developers that need extra hardware in touch with 
companies/individuals with extra hardware that they wish to donate to 
help Gentoo.

Motivation
==========

There are some developers out there that are using very slow hardware, and some
that have broken equipment that they could put back into use if they only 
had one more part. This program will help developers get the most out of 
there exisiting hardware and fix any systems that may currently be broken.

Specification
=============

This is a pretty low risk proposal for Gentoo Linux since it only affects 
me, and whoever else wishes to help out. This project would keep very 
detailed records of everything that came in and out. We would actually not 
handle any hardware. We would just facilitate connecting hardware with 
needy developers.

Rationale
=========

KDE does this [1]_, and I've sent an email to the guy who runs the project over 
there, to see how well it has worked out for them. I think this would 
benefit certain developers and Gentoo as a whole.
