Definitions
===========

	*Web Application*
		an application that requires a web server to function and interacts with
		the user via a browser

	*Web Application Instance*
		An apparent install of the Web Application that is served up via the
		webserver. There may be any number of instances per Web Application.
		This is a major use for web applications. Our Gentoo Zope setup
		already provides instances and can be used for some concepts on this
		matter.

	*Web Application Setup Program*
		A script similar in function to zope-config that sets up instances.

	*Document Root*
		a location in the file system that forms the main document tree visible from
		the web

Conventions
===========

	When describing the location of a directory in the file system it
	wil be shown *with* a trailing slash, eg::

		/foo/bar/

	When describing the location of a specific file (irrespective of any
	file extention) it will shown *with out* a trailing slash, eg::

		/foo/blah

Abstract
========

To define where and how web based applications should be installed by Gentoo.

Motivation
==========

Currently there is no standard defined regarding the installation of web
based applicaitons in Gentoo.  This leads to ebuild authors creating a
variety of methods to determine:

	* where the application should be installed
	* what user and permissions the application should be given
	* where any configuration files related to the application should be
	  installed.

Due to a lack of standard install method configuration files are at
risk of being overwritten during upgrade, potentially causing system
administrators down tine as they have to reconfigure web applications
after an upgrade.

Rationale
=========

A discussion on the gentoo-dev mailing list [#WebAppPost1]_ raised the
following points regarding how Gentoo handles the installation of web based
applications:

	1. Gentoo installed web applications (eg: horde, phpbb, cacti,
	   phpmysql) should not be installed in the Document Root of a web server.
	2. Web applications should not have their configuration files installed
	   under the Document Root of a web server.

		i. Web Application must be slotted by their major version numbers to
		   further avoid downtime when true configuration changes are required.

	3. Web applications should not be owned by the same user as the web server.
	4. It should be easily possible to have multiple instances of a web
	   application without any duplication of source files.
	5. It should be immediately apparent how to control instances of a web
	   application.

Implementation
==============

Max Kalika <max@gentoo.org> stated that he has a preliminary eclass that
implements a good deal of this GLEP.

Stuart Herbert <stuart@gentoo.org> has committed::

	webapp-apache.eclass

to CVS, this is a stop-gap measure whilst this GLEP is being finalised.


1. Web Server
---------------------

A common default web server will have to be selected and ebuild authors should
ensure that their applications contain configuration directives suitable for
that server.  Given the popularity of the Apache web server it is suggested
that Apache be selected as the Gentoo default web server.

Whilst it is acknowledged that other web servers do exist and are used, there
has to be an assumption made somewhere that people who choose to use something
other than the default have enough knowledge to adapt configurations
accordingly.

1.1 Default Document Root
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

To ensure the greatest flexibility when installing applications the following
*Document Root* locations are to be used:

	* For single host installations::

		/var/www/localhost/htdocs/

	* For multiple virtual host installastions::

		/var/www/<fully qualified domain name>/htdocs/
		eg:
			/var/www/www.gentoo.org/htdocs/

1.2 Apache 2
''''''''''''''''''''''''

All web application .ebuild will honour any USE flags that are intended to
add support for Apache 2 as well as supporting Apache 1 installations.


2. Virtual Host Flexibility
---------------------------

In a similar vein to Gentoo's Zope scripts, namely zope-config, we
should be able to have multiple instances of a single web application
without duplicating all of the files.

This also allows system administrators to control where web applications
will appear on their system, as well as to customize a file in a single
instance of a web application without effecting the original material.

This is easily acheived thru use of Apache configuration directivies and
symlinks. For PHP instances, see http://tavi.sourceforge.net/VirtualHosts
for some details.

The primary idea here is that to the web-application, it appears that
all of it's configuration and files are in the instance directory, but
the files are physicalled located elsewhere.

2.1 New "vhost" USE Flag
''''''''''''''''''''''''

To enable support for multiple virtual host installations a new USE flag is
to be added to Portage. The use flag will be::

	vhost

When *vhost* is _set_ the installation location and configuration for the web
application will be effected, see below for more details.

2.2 VHost Configuration Tool
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To assist administration of multiple virtual hosts a "VHost Configuration Tool"
needs to be developed and implemented.  Initial discussion and regarding the VHost
Config tool can be found at http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.devel/10874.

The VHost Configuration Utility will need to be a seperate package, maintained by Gentoo.
Apache .ebuilds will require the VHost Config tool as a dependency (DEPEND).

3. Application Installation Location
------------------------------------

The current accepted standard Document Root in Gentoo is /home/httpd.  The
discussion suggest that this is not the best location to install web based
applications.

Web applications should be installed outside of the Document Root using the following
defaults:

	* for files to be served to clients::

		/usr/share/webapps/${PF}/

		/usr/share/webapps/${PF}/public_html/ for files served by the web server

		/usr/share/webapps/${PF}/cgi-bin/ for CGI-BIN files

	* install configuration files in::

		/etc/webapps/${PF}/

	* for documentation files (not served to clients)::

		/usr/share/doc/${PF}/

3.1 Single Host Installation
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

For single host installations the .ebuild will make the required
configurations changes and symlinks using the VHost Config tool to ensure
that the web application is available to be served from::

	/var/www/localhost/htdocs/${PN}

3.2 Virtual Host Installation
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

For installations that support multiple virtual hosts the .ebuild will
install the web application into the default location and then leave configuration
to the user through the VHost Config tool.

4. Application Configuration
----------------------------

Having application configuration files in the Document Root of a web
server is a potential security risk.  Additionally given the way that many
ebuilds currently install web applications it can also lead to the
overwriting of important configuration files.

As stated above web application configuration files are to be installed into::

	/etc/webapps/${PF}/

By installing application configuration files in /etc Portage CONFIG_PROTECT
features can be used to ensure that configuration files are not overwritten.

4.1 Virtual Host Support

<< TO BE EXPANDED UPON >>

5. Application Permissions
--------------------------

Installing web applications and giving the web server ownership of the files
is a security risk.  This can possibly lead to application configuration
files being accessed by unwanted third parties.

All web applications should be owned by *root* unless the application
absolutely requires write access to its installation directories at execution
time.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

There may be some issues regarding compatibility with existing installs of
web applications.  This is particularly true if the default Document Root is
moved from what is accepted as the current standard (/home/httpd).

The main issues are:
	* transition of existing configuration files to the
	  /etc/webapps/${PF}/ directory.
	* modification/reconfiguration of applications so that they
	  are aware of the location of configuration files.
	* creating approriate Apache configuration snippets for inclusion
	  in the Apache configuration files.
