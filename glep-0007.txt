Abstract
========

This GLEP proposes that we extend the current proposed management
structure by adding a position of Ombudsman that would fall under
devrel, qa, and pr.  An ombudsman is one who has been assigned to 
*impartially* investigate complaints and settle disputes.

Motivation
==========

Given the impressive numbers of both Gentoo developers and users, it is
inevitable that there will be occasional clashes between developers and
managers, developers and developers, and developers and users.  Right
now there is no mechanism to prevent such disputes from escalating out
of control.

Specification
=============

One developer (and one backup) will be appointed as ombudsmen.  This
positions should be far from a full-time job.  It would appear as part
of the devrel, qa, and pr projects (inasmuch as qa and pr both involve
developer-user relations).  Infrastructure requirements are an
ombudsman.gentoo.org web page and a ombudsman@gentoo.org e-mail 
alias. 

Rationale
=========

One traditional method (circa early 1800s in Sweden, apparently [#RIT]_)
for managing disputes is to have an impartial individual whose job it
is to investigate complaints and mediate settlements.  A quick search 
on Google [#GOOGLE]_ reveals numerous government agencies, universities,
and industries that employ official ombudsmen.  The key requirement for
an ombudsman to be effective is support from management and trust from
users and developers -- the ombudsmen must be considered by all to be
reasonably impartial.  

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

No conflicts.
