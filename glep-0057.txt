Abstract
========
This is the first in a series of 4 GLEPs. It aims to define the actors
and problems in the Gentoo software distribution process, with a strong
emphasis on security. The concepts thus developed, will then be used in
the following GLEPs to describe a comprehensive security solution for
this distribution process that prevents trivial attacks and increases
the difficulty on more complex attacks. 

Motivation
==========
Since at mid-2002 (see endnote: "History of tree-signing in Gentoo"),
many discussions have taken place on the gentoo-dev mailing list and in
many other places to design and implement a security strategy for the
distribution of files by the Gentoo project.

Usually the goal of such proposals was and is to be able to securely
identify the data provided by Gentoo and prevent third parties (like a
compromised mirror) from delivering harmful data (be it as modified
ebuilds, executable shell code or any other form) to the users of the
Gentoo MetaDistribution.

These strategies can neither prevent a malicious or compromised upstream
from injecting "bad" programs, nor can they stop a rogue developer from
committing malicious ebuilds. What they can do is to reduce the attack
vectors so that for example a compromised mirror will be detected and no
tainted data will be executed on user's systems.

Gentoo's software distribution system as it presently stands, contains a
number of security shortcomings. The last discussion on the gentoo-dev
mailing list [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.devel/38363]
contains a good overview of most of the issues. Summarized here:

 - Unverifiable executable code distributed:
   The most obvious instance are eclasses, but there are many other bits
   of the tree that are not signed at all right now. Modifying that data
   is trivial.
 - Shortcomings of existing Manifest verification
   A lack and enforcement of policies, combined with suboptimal support
   in portage, makes it trivial to modify or replace the existing
   Manifests. 
 - Vulnerability of existing infrastructure to attacks.
   The previous two items make it possible for a skilled attacker to
   design an attack and then execute it against specific portions of
   existing infrastructure (e.g.: Compromise a country-local rsync
   mirror, and totally replace a package and it's Manifest).

Specification
=============
Security is not something that can be considered in isolation. It is
both an ongoing holistic process and lessons learnt by examining
previous shortcomings.

System Elements
---------------
There are a few entities to be considered:
 - Upstream. The people who provide the program(s) or data we wish to
   distribute.
 - Gentoo Developers. The people that package and test the things
   provided by Upstream.
 - Gentoo Infrastructure. The people and hardware that allow the revision
   control of metadata and distribution of the data and metadata provided
   by Developers and Upstream.
 - Gentoo Mirrors. Hardware provided by external contributors that is not
   or only marginally controlled by Gentoo Infrastructure. Needed to
   achieve the scalability and performance needed for the substantial
   Gentoo user base.
 - Gentoo Users. The people that use the Gentoo MetaDistribution.

The data described here is usually programs and data files provided by
upstream; as this is a rather large amount of data it is usually
distributed over http or ftp from Gentoo Mirrors. This data is usually
labeled as "distfiles". Metadata is all information describing how to
manipulate that data - it is usually called "The Tree" or "The Portage
Tree", consists of many ebuilds, eclasses and supporting files and is
usually distributed over rsync. The central rsync servers are controlled
by Gentoo Infrastructure, but many third-party rsync mirrors exist that
help to reduce the load on those central servers. These extra mirrors
are not maintained by Gentoo Infrastructure.

Attacks may be conducted against any of these entities. Obviously
direct attacks against Upstream and Users are outside of the scope of
this series of GLEPs as they are not in any way controlled or
controllable by Gentoo - however attacks using Gentoo as a conduit
(including malicious mirrors) must be considered.

Processes
---------
There are two major processes in the distribution of Gentoo, where
security needs to be implemented:

 - Developer commits to version control systems controlled by
   Infrastructure.
 - Tree and distfile distribution from Infrastructure to Users, via the
   mirrors (this includes both HTTP and rsync distribution).

Both processes need their security improved. In [GLEPxx2] we will discuss
how to improve the security of the first process. The relatively
speaking simpler process of file distribution will be described in
[GLEP58]. Since it can be implemented without having to change the
workflow and behaviour of developers we hope to get it done in a
reasonably short timeframe.

Attacks against Processes
-------------------------
Attacks against the process #1 may be as complex as a malicious or
compromised developer (stolen SSH keys, rooted systems), or as simple as
a patch from a user that does a little more than it claims, and is not
adequately reviewed.

Attacks against the process #2 may be as simple as a single rooted
mirror, distributing a modified tree to the users of that mirror - or
some alteration of upstream sources. These attacks have a low cost and
are very hard to discover unless all distributed data is transparently
signed.

A simple example of such an attack and a partial solution for eclasses
is presented in [ http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.devel/24677
]. It shows quite well that any non-Gentoo controlled rsync mirror can
modify executable code; as much of this code is per default run as root
a malicious mirror could compromise hundreds of systems per day - if
cloaked well enough, such an attack could run for weeks before being
noticed. As there are no effective safeguards right now users are left
with the choice of either syncing from the sometimes slow or even
unresponsive Gentoo-controlled rsync mirrors or risk being compromised
by syncing from one of the community-provided mirrors. We will show that
protection against this class of attacks is very easy to implement with
little added cost. 

At the level of mirrors, addition of malicious content is not the only
attack. As discussed by Cappos et al [C08a,C08b], an attacker may use
exclusion and replay attacks, possibly only on a specific subset of
user to extend the window of opportunity on another exploit.

Security for Processes
------------------------
Protection for process #1 can never be complete (without major
modifications to our development process), as a malicious developer is
fully authorized to provide materials for distribution. Partial
protection can be gained by Portage and Infrastructure changes, but the
real improvements needed are developer education and continued
vigilance. This is further discussed in [GLEPxx2].

This security is still limited in scope - protection against compromised
developers is very expensive, and even complex systems like peer review
/ multiple signatures can be broken by colluding developers. There are many
issues, be it social or technical, that increase the cost of such
measures a lot while only providing marginal security gains. Any
implementation proposal must be carefully analysed to find the best
security to developer hassle ratio.

Protection for process #2 is a different matter entirely. While it also
cannot be complete (as the User may be attacked directly), we can ensure
that Gentoo infrastructure and the mirrors are not a weak point. This
objective is actually much closer than it seems already - most of the
work has been completed for other things!. This is further discussed in
[GLEP58]. As this process has the most to gain in security, and the
most immediate impact, it should be implemented before or at the same
time as any changes to process #1. Security at this layer is already
available in the signed daily snapshots, but we can extend it to cover
the rsync mirrors as well.

Requirements pertaining to and management of keys (OpenPGP or otherwise)
is an issue that affects both processes, and is broken out into a
separate GLEP due to the technical complexity of the subject.
This deals with everything including: types of keys to use; usage
guidelines; procedures for managing signatures and trust for keys,
including cases of lost (destroyed) and stolen (or otherwise turned
malicious) keys.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================
As an informational GLEP, this document has no direct impact on
backwards compatibility. However the related in-depth documents may
delve further into any issues of backwards compatibility.

Endnote: History of tree-signing in Gentoo
==========================================
This is a brief review of every previous tree-signing discussion, the
stuff before 2003-04-03 was very hard to come by, so I apologize if I've
missed a discussion (I would like to hear about it). I think there was
a very early private discussion with drobbins in 2001, as it's vaguely
referenced, but I can't find it anywhere.

2002-06-06, gentoo-dev mailing list, users first ask about signing of
ebuilds:
[ http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.devel/1950 ]

2003-01-13, gentoo-dev mailing list, "Re: Verifying portage is from
Gentoo" - Paul de Vrieze (pauldv):

2003-04, gentoo-security mailing list, "The state of ebuild signing
in portage" - Joshua Brindle (method), the first suggestion of signed Manifests,
but also an unusual key-trust model:

2003-04, gentoo-core mailing list, "New Digests and Signing -- Attempted Explanation"

2003-06, gentoo-core mailing list, "A quick guide to GPG and key
signing." - This overview was one of the first to help developers see
how to use their devs, and was mainly intended for keysigning meetups.

2003-08-09, gentoo-core mailing list, "Ebuild signing" - status query,
with an not very positive response, delayed by Nick Jones (carpaski)
getting rooted and a safe cleanup taking a long time to affect.

2003-12-02, gentoo-core mailing list, "Report: rsync1.it.gentoo.org compromised"

2003-12-03, gentoo-core mailing list, "Signing of ebuilds"

2003-12-07, gentoo-core mailing list, "gpg signing of Manifests", thread
includes the first GnuPG signing prototype code, by Robin H. Johnson
(robbat2). Andrew Cowie (rac) also produces a proof-of-concept around
this time.

2004-03-23, gentoo-dev mailing list, "2004.1 will not include a secure
portage" - Kurt Lieber (klieber). Signing is nowhere near ready for
2004.1 release, and it is realized that it there is insufficient traction
and the problem is very large. Many arguments about the checking and
verification side. First warning signs that MD5 might be broken in the
near future.

2004-03-25, gentoo-dev mailing list, "Redux: 2004.1 will not include a
secure portage" - Robin H. Johnson (robbat2). Yet another proposal,
summarizing the points of the previous thread and this time trying to
track the various weaknesses.
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=gentoo-dev&m=108017986400698&w=2

2004-05-31, Gentoo managers meeting, portage team reports that
FEATURES=sign is now available, but large questions still exist over
verification policies and procedures, as well as handing of keys.
[ http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/manager-meetings/logs/2004/20040531.txt ]

2005-01-17, gentoo-core mailing list, "Global objective for 2005 :
portage signing". Thierry Carrez (koon) suggests that more go into
tree-signing work. Problems at the time later in the thread show that
the upstream gpg-agent is not ready, amongst other minor implementation
issues.

2005-02-20, gentoo-dev mailing list, "post-LWE 2005" - Brian Harring
(ferringb). A discussion on the ongoing lack of signing, and that
eclasses and profiles need to be signed as well, but this seems to be
hanging on GLEP33 in the meantime.
[ http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.devel/25556/focus=25596 ] 

2005-03-08, gentoo-core mailing list, "gpg manifest signing stats".
Informal statistics show that 26% of packages in the tree include a
signed Manifest. Questions are raised regarding key types, and key
policies.

2005-11-16, gentoo-core mailing list, "Gentoo key signing practices and
official Gentoo keyring". A discussion of key handling and other
outstanding issues, also mentioning partial Manifests, as well as a
comparision between the signing procedures used in Slackware, Debian and
RPM-based distros.

Thanks
======
I'd like to thank Patrick Lauer (bonsaikitten) for prodding me
to keep working on the tree-signing project, as well helping with
spelling, grammar, research (esp. tracking down every possible
vulnerability that has been mentioned in past discussions, and
integrating them in this overview).
