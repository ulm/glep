Abstract
========

This GLEP proposes the creation of "Planet Gentoo", a new section of the
gentoo.org website.  It would aggregate weblogs (commonly known as "blogs")
written by contributing Gentoo developers onto this single page, available to
the public.  I will refer to this new website section as "the planet" in this
GLEP.
We would also provide an installation of a weblog engine for developers that
do not currently have their own weblog.

Motivation
==========

I'm trying to reduce the gap between the Gentoo user and development
communities.

Many large open source projects and software distributors have their own
Planet where contributors weblogs are aggregated.  See the `Planetplanet`_
homepage for a complete listing.  These other aggregations appear to be
successful and bring their relevant communities together.

These aggregations are often quite interesting to read, since they contain a
variation of topics, not all of which are related to the project.

The planet would add another method of user interaction with developers, as
most weblogs allow readers to post comments.

Readers would get more interested in the Gentoo project, and would get a feel
for the personalities of the contributing developers.  Although I am not
suggesting this should be used as an announcement tool, developers could also
use this to get general messages over to the user community.

Specification
=============

The proposed design is an installation of Planetplanet at a part of the
gentoo.org infrastructure, e.g. http://planet.gentoo.org

We would also provide an installation of `Wordpress`_ or a similar weblogging
engine, for developers that do not have their own weblog or would wish to
move their log to an official Gentoo hosted website.  This could be provided
at (e.g.) http://weblogs.gentoo.org

Rationale
=========

`Planetplanet`_ is simply a weblog aggregator written in python.  It is
executed as a cronjob and fetches content from all the weblogs it has been
asked to, postprocesses and aggregates them into a single html file (based on
a template), and outputs that html content to an area provided by a webserver.
This should allow for ease of integration with any existing infrastructure.

A group of people would be assigned the responsibility/CVS access to maintain
the planetplanet configuration file, which lists the developers weblogs to be
aggregated.  They would also be required to maintain the weblog engine
provided, this is done through a web-based administration interface.  I would
suggest the existing infrastructure team to have this responsibility.

The planetplanet installation would fetch and aggregate developers weblogs
only, we would not accept non-developer logs.

Developers do not have to host their weblogs with us, practically all blogging
packages provide an XML feed (typically RSS) which planetplanet will happily
fetch and process.  Other feed formats are also accepted, examine the
planetplanet documentation for more info.

It has been suggested that the activity of the planet may be an issue:
although a lot of activity would make the planet very successful, it may look
bad on us as a whole if the planet is inactive.

`Alexander Plank`_ started a `gentoo-dev discussion`_ back in August regarding
this exact idea.  Alexander set up a `Planet Gentoo mini-survey`_ to see which
developers have weblogs or would be interested in obtaining one to be
aggregated on the planet.  At the time of writing, the survey yielded a list
of 21 interested developers.

Looking at the other planets available, a contributor count like this would be
more than enough to keep the planet active and interesting.  Through my
experiments of finding developers existing weblogs through google and
aggregating them on my local Planetplanet installation, I have come to the
conclusion that just a small quantity of active weblogs is enough to keep the
planet going strongly.

I also note that the list of 21 interested developers was built up over a
short space of time, and it was only mentioned once in a rather large thread
on the gentoo-dev mailing list.  I predict that given more publicity amongst
the developers, this idea would be even more popular.  I also predict that if
such a planet were to go live, other developers would be motivated to join in,
and new developers joining the project would be keen on contributing.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

No issues.

Reference Implementation
========================

See `Bug 63160`_ for a template file mimicking the current gentoo.org design
plus a sample config file.
