Definitions
============

   *APP*
      A graphical application that should be listed in the menus.
   *WM*
      A program containing a menu manager (i.e. a program that can display a menu, e.g. a windowmanager).
   *rule file*
      A python script that describes how to build the menu for a WM.



Abstract
========

This GLEP handles a proposal for the following two goals:

* Create a common menu layout, which would be independent of the WM.
  This point sound quite important for those people who use more than one WM. 
* Provide a common way to add applications to the menus.



Motivation
==========

GNOME, KDE, Fluxbox, to name only a few, have all their own ways of handling
menus. There have been several requests [1]_ [2]_ [3]_ [4]_ [5]_ [6]_ from
users to streamline these menus. Furthermore there are several bug reports
about applications not having a menu entry [7]_, but since there is not
standard way to create such an entry, they are just sitting around in
bugzilla.



Rationale
=========

The idea of a common menu system is not new to the Linux world, every big
distribution (Debian, Mandrake, RedHat, Suse) has such a system. The big DE's,
KDE and GNOME, with the help of freedesktop.org [8]_ are also trying to
implement one standard. That will most likely happen in GNOME 2.6 and KDE 3.2
(Currently they are only implementing different versions of the
desktop-entry-spec, but interpreting it in an incompatible way).  But there
are still many other WM's around that are not going to follow these specs in
the near future. So we are trying to base our work on the specifications GNOME
and KDE are going to use. (These are no official standards but evolving
specifications). This has the following advantages:

* follow specified standards
* i18n support
* provide the necessary flexibility and modularity 
* integrate with small changes to our ebuildtree.
* support for per system and per user menus

This system will be completely optional, nobody will be forced to use it!

Here an short overview, how it is supposed work:

1. Every APP installs a .desktop file.
2. Every WM installs a rule file.
3. There is a file which specifies the menu layout.
4. A script is run and parses all rule and .desktop files and the menu
   layout and creates the corresponding menus.

We also intent to include a graphical editor for the menus, but this is not
the primary priority.



Specification
=============

1. What packages with an APP should do
--------------------------------------------

1.1 .desktop file format
'''''''''''''''''''''''''
If you want users to be able to find your application you have to create a
menu entry in the following format::

   [Desktop Entry]
   Encoding=UTF-8
   Type=Application
   Name=KWord
   GenericName=Word Processing
   GenericName[it]=Textverarbeitung
   Categories=Application;Office;Wordprocessor
   Icon=kword
   Exec=/usr/kde/3.1/bin/kword

This example does not show all translations of the name and comment, but you
can see the format of the file and translations from it. The Categories field
specifies which menu group the application should appear under. In this
example, the entry is under System Tools. 

The file should follow the xdg desktop-entry spec 0.9.4 [9]_. The Categories
field is used as described in the menu-spec 0.7 [10]_.


1.2 Validating the file
''''''''''''''''''''''''
We will provide a tool (possibly included in repoman) which will validate
.desktop files.


1.3 Icon
'''''''''
There are two possibilities to install an icon for the application.

1. You install an icon in /usr/share/pixmaps and specify the absolute path to
   the file in the .desktop file.
2. You install the file as part of an icon-theme [11]_ and specify the name of
   the icon in the .desktop file. Possible icon-themes are:

   * default.kde
   * gnome
   * gentoo

The preferred format for icons is png with transparent background.


1.4 Modifying the ebuild
'''''''''''''''''''''''''
To actually install this file, you have add it to the filesdir of the ebuild.
The extension has to be .desktop. Then change the ebuild to contain a line
similar to this: "domenu ${FILESDIR}/file.desktop".


2. What packages with a WM should do
---------------------------------------------
Each WM should provide a rule file in /usr/share/menus/wms which follows a
specific format. Documentation for this format has still to be written, You
can find examples at [12]_.


3. The Menu layout file
-------------------------

The format of the menu layout file will follow the xdg menu-spec 0.7 [10]_.

Gentoo will provide a default menu structure. You can find the current
proposal at [14]_.



4. Customizing the menus
------------------------

Customizing of this system can be done in two ways, system-wide or user-wide.
The locations of the files follow the xdg basedir-spec 0.6 [14]_.

4.1 Changing the default menu layout
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
The system menu layout is located in /etc/menu/applications.menu, it can be
overridden by $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/applications.menu.


4.2 Adding own WM files
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
The system WM files are located in $XDG_DATA_DIRS/menu/wms/, they can be
overridden or extended by $XDG_DATA_HOME/wms/.


4.3 Adding own menu entries
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
The system .desktop files are located in $XDG_DATA_DIRS/menu/applications/,
they can be overridden or extended by $XDG_DATA_HOME/menu/applications/.



Drawbacks
=========

A concern might be that it involves a changing a lot of ebuilds (every APP
needs to be changed). There has been a proposal for another solution that
generates menus from the current menu structures of GNOME/KDE. This would have
the advantage of not changing the ebuilds, but the disadvantage of not being
very flexible. A menu layout file or per system/users menus would not be
possibly.  It seems more like a quick and dirty solution. Consider that we
don't have to provide massive file-updates, global lists coherent with our
tree, but each capable and installed package requires a small change that goes
back and forwards with versions without overhead for version bumps.



Backwards Compatibility
=======================

People who want to use the new system have to recompile all packages that use
the "gentoo-menu" USE flag. This could be easily done by a tool that will parse
/var/db/pkg and for all ebuilds find corresponding updates with menu info.

Since nobody is forced to use this system, there are no other backward
compatibility issues, you just have to disable the "gentoo-menu" USE-Flag and
you'll get the vanilla situation.



Reference Implementation
========================

The reference implementation is nearly finished, it's written in Python, you
can find it here [15]_ [16]_. It contains a sample menu layout
(/etc/menu/applications.menu), the domenu script, the update-menus script and
the gentoo icon theme.

Domenu has to be included in Portage, it will install new menu entries in
/usr/share/menu/applications and run the update-menus script afterwards.

Update-menus parses the menu layout file, the .desktop files and the rule
files and then creates the menus. If run as user it will create menus only for
that user, if run as root it will create system wide menus.
